Welcome to the EFT MiniGuide. The purpose of this website is to create a guide that is focused on new/ early game players. This guide has bite sized,
new player oriented guides on maps and quests as well as tips for general gameplay, settings, quests, and maps.

While there are other guide that exist with much more detail, this website is made to be simple and to give the necissary information along with personal
and community tips.

Tarkov is a very challenging game by design. On top of that, the developers do not hold your hand for a second when you start out. While nothing beats 
having a someone guide you through the beginning stages, many Tarkov player like myself will spend the majority of their time trying to learn the game
on their own. This guide will hopefully be able to be there to guide you in their stead. With a goal to be community grown, the tips scattered throughout 
should be those learned from players who have been in your shoes many times before.
