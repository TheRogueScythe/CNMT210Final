            <h2> Welcome To the EFT Mini Guide</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to the EFT MiniGuide. The purpose of this website is to create a guide that is focused on new/ early game players. This guide has bite sized,<br>
                new player oriented guides on maps and quests as well as tips for general gameplay, settings, quests, and maps.<br>
                <br>
                While there are other guide that exist with much more detail, this website is made to be simple and to give the necissary information along with personal<br>
                and community tips. <br>
                <br>
                Tarkov is a very challenging game by design. On top of that, the developers do not hold your hand for a second when you start out. While nothing beats  <br>
                having a someone guide you through the beginning stages, many Tarkov player like myself will spend the majority of their time trying to learn the game  <br>
                on their own. This guide will hopefully be able to be there to guide you in their stead. With a goal to be community grown, the tips scattered throughout  <br>
                should be those learned from players who have been in your shoes many times before.  <br>
