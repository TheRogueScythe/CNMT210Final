Welcome to the EFT MiniGuide. The purpose of this website is to create a guide that is focused on new/ early game players. This guide has bite sized, <br>
new player oriented guides on maps and quests as well as tips for general gameplay, settings, quests, and maps. <br>
<br>
While there are other guide that exist with much more detail, this website is made to be simple and to give the necissary information along with personal<br>
and community tips. <br>
<br>
Tarkov is a very challenging game by design. On top of that, the developers do not hold your hand for a second when you start out. While nothing beats  <br>
having a someone guide you through the beginning stages, many Tarkov player like myself will spend the majority of their time trying to learn the game  <br>
on their own. This guide will hopefully be able to be there to guide you in their stead. With a goal to be community grown, the tips scattered throughout  <br>
should be those learned from players who have been in your shoes many times before.  <br>
<br>
While the learning curve in Tarkov can be steep, this guide aims to smooth that curve, offering concise insights to help you navigate the complexities <br>
of the game more easily. From understanding each map, all the early quest, or just general knowlege, this guide aims to provide you with the tools <br>
and knowledge needed to thrive in the challenging world of Escape From Tarkov. <br>
<br>
Remember, Tarkov is as much about learning from your experiences as it is about surviving them. We hope this guide enhances your journey and empowers you <br>
to emerge stronger after each raid. <br>
