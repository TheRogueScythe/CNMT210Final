            <h2> Welcome To the EFT Mini Guide</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to the EFT MiniGuide. The purpose of this website is to create a guide that is focused on new/ early game players. This guide has bite sized, <br>
                new player oriented guides on maps and quests as well as tips for general gameplay, settings, quests, and maps. <br>
                <br>
                Even though there are other guide that exist with much more detail, this website is made to be simple and to give the necissary information along with personal<br>
                and community tips. <br>
                <br>
                Tarkov is a very challenging game by design. On top of that, the developers do not hold your hand for a second when you start out. While nothing beats  <br>
                having a someone guide you through the beginning stages, many Tarkov player like myself will spend the majority of their time trying to learn the game  <br>
                on their own. This guide will hopefully be able to be there to guide you in their stead. With a goal to be community grown, the tips scattered throughout  <br>
                should be those learned from players who have been in your shoes many times before.  <br>
                <br>
                While the learning curve in Tarkov can be steep, this guide aims to smooth that curve, offering concise insights to help you navigate the complexities <br>
                of the game more easily. From understanding each map, all the early quest, or just general knowlege, this guide aims to provide you with <br>
                the tools and knowledge needed to thrive in the challenging world of Escape From Tarkov. <br>
                <br>
                Remember, Tarkov is as much about learning from your raids as it is about surviving them. We hope this guide enhances your journey and empowers you <br>
                to emerge stronger after each raid. <br>
